# Risk Assessor
This is a project designed to help probation officers fill out the risk assessment part of the OASys form.

## Sections R10.1 to R10.5
Help will be in the form of checkboxes and dropdown selections, and an opportunity to write and expand upon the template answers.

No data will be saved: the aim is to provide text which can be copied into the OASys form.

## Risk management plan (R11.12 and sections 1 to 8 of the risk management plan)
We will aim to meet the QA standard, via prompts and short answer quesitons.
